# AI-Driven Deepfake Detection for Digital Content Integrity
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to build a **real-time, multimodal deepfake detection system** integrated with **blockchain-based media provenance tracking**. It is designed to verify the authenticity of digital content—images, videos, and audio—using AI-based forensic analysis and ensure tamper-proof traceability.

Developed under the Safe & Trusted AI initiative, the system addresses the growing threat of misinformation in India and supports fair, explainable, and secure AI deployment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect manipulated digital content using **AI models** trained on images, audio, and metadata.
- Provide **real-time inference** and **explainable AI (XAI)** outputs to support trust and transparency.
- Ensure media authenticity using **blockchain hashing and smart contracts** for provenance tracking.
- Design for **scalability, multilingual support**, and low-resource settings across Indian regions.

---

## 🧠 Core Features

- **Multimodal Detection Engine:** Combines CNNs, Vision Transformers, and GAN detectors for media analysis.
- **Forensic Layer:** Detects inconsistencies in lip-sync, blink rates, metadata (e.g., timestamps, camera info).
- **XAI Module:** Generates Grad-CAM heatmaps and attention maps to explain AI predictions.
- **Blockchain Provenance Tracker:** Stores media hashes and forensic fingerprints using smart contracts.
- **User Interfaces:** REST APIs, browser plugin, and mobile app for content verification.
